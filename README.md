# 🕹️ The Upwell

**The Upwell** is a text-based, turn-based RPG built in Java. You awaken at the bottom of a mysterious dungeon well with no memory of how you got there. 
Equipped with a weapon of your choice, you must ascend toward the light — facing dangerous monsters, making decisions, and discovering hidden secrets along the way.
